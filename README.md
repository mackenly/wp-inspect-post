## What does it do?
If you've ever used [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io/) you may be familiar with the Inspect feature within Sanity Studio. Inspect allows you to see your content object much like your code sees it. This makes it easy to work with data returned from Sanity, becasue it's easy to see what's avaliable and what the values are. The goal of this plugin is to bring similar funcionality to WordPress by showing the results of the WP API in the post editor.
